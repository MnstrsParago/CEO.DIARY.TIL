Today stood out from the rest — I walked over 15,000 steps in one day.
Since I didn’t have much money on me, I ended up walking all the way from my friend’s place to Astana Hub.

Later, I started a new SQL module as part of the course, but the database structure looked very familiar.
This might’ve held me back — I only completed two tasks. I also passed a test on GetCourse successfully.
The tasks were easy, but because the content was mostly review, it ended up being mentally tiring.

On the bright side, I managed to do five (maybe six) sets of 5 pull-ups — not bad at all.
