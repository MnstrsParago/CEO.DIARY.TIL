## 26th June 2025

The day started with a solid breakfast and a spark of curiosity.
I spent the morning exploring a new project on a friend's account — it involved NFT-based gifting through Telegram. I haven’t fully wrapped my head around it yet.

Strangely enough, I seem to have a talent: whenever I start studying something new, people or opportunities related to it start showing up almost immediately.
That evening, I met someone who understood the concept well, and through our conversation, I began to grasp how these systems work. I might collaborate with him in the future — although for now, the project isn’t fully aligned with my perspective.

Later in the day, I had a deep conversation with a friend, played some dombra, and discussed team-building ideas with my roommate at the dorm.
Nothing is concrete yet, but I’d love to form a solid team with real potential — something worth investing my energy, time, and even money into.
