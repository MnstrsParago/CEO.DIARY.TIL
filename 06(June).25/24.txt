## 24th June 2025

Today was quite productive again.
In the morning, I fixed the bed, did a thorough cleaning, and got everything ready for inspection. The apartment check went smoothly — I'm officially moving out of the dorm, but only on June 30th.

Later, I went swimming and covered another 960 meters. I’ve also started learning the “Crawl” technique to improve my form.

In the evening, I decided to crash at a friend’s place — he needed help with Gitea.
And just to finish myself off properly, I wrapped up the day by completing a mini-project in Excel.
