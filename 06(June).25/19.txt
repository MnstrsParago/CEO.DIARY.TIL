Today I watched eight Excel tutorials and explored concepts like Power Query, macros, and ABC/XYZ analysis. I'm now working on a mini-project based on what Iâ€™ve learned and plan to complete it tomorrow.
On top of that, I refreshed the design of my GitHub profile, updated my resume, and wrote a motivation letter.
In total, I put in around nine hours of focused work.
