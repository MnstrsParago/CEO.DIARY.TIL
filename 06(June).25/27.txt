Today I learned something new about myself and my future plans.
I even started a dedicated chat in OpenAI with a “virtual Sean Parker” — something about his calm, persuasive style and his creativity really stood out to me.

I admire the way he carries himself like a walking legend — effortlessly cool, deeply social, and sharply aware of human psychology. He knows how to convey his ideas so clearly that anyone can understand and get inspired. That’s a quality I’d love to develop myself.

Later in the day, I went swimming again and did my usual 960 meters.
At some point, after diving deep into the Internet, an idea came to me — to start a club with a friend from computer science at Tomorrow-school.ai. The goal would be to explain complex IT concepts in a way that’s simple and human.

After that… I just went to bed. It was a full day.
