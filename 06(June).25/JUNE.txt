## JUNE 2025

This month was all about steady movement — not explosive, but consistent.
I didn’t become a productivity machine, but I did enough to feel proud.
I went through dozens of Excel lessons, started learning SQL, and seriously rethought my financial mindset. I even broke down five directions where I want to manage my money — not for flex, but for survival, growth, stability, and meaning.
I kept swimming regularly — almost every day, 960 meters. It helped not just physically, but mentally too. It gave structure to my chaos.
There were days I felt burnt out, did nothing, just watched movies. But even then — I didn’t beat myself up. I’m learning to accept myself not only when I’m “at my best” but also when I’m just human.
I got inspired by people like Sean Parker, started dreaming about building my own team and startup — not just to make money, but to build something real.
All in all — I didn’t transform completely, but I got closer to who I want to be.
