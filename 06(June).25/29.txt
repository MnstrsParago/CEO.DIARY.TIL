This day was fairly productive, though I lacked energy throughout.
The morning started strong: five sets of five pull-ups, a solid breakfast, and then I sat down at my desk to reflect on my personal finances.

I realized that before I can afford anything, I simply need to start earning. That’s the key to unlocking any kind of movement forward. I identified five core financial directions that matter most to me:
1. Basic Needs — the essentials for survival and day-to-day balance: food, housing, self-care items, and cleaning supplies for my living space.
2. Short-Term Investments — things that give quick returns or improve the quality of life now.
Like a laptop stand to work more comfortably, a power bank to stay productive anywhere, or useful courses that sharpen my skills and can later be monetized.
3. Long-Term Investments — things that grow over time: saving for a future home, building an IT startup, or supporting people around me.
I don’t need them to return the money. If I can help someone take a step forward — that’s my return. Even if they go their own way later, I’ll know I played a part. Not just because I gave, but because I gave it to someone who needed it — and believed in them.
4. Personal Joy & “Wants” — the things that fuel motivation and bring emotional returns.
Saving up for a trip, buying something I’ve always wanted, or dressing in a way that boosts my confidence — all of that helps me stay focused and feel like myself.
5. Financial Cushion (Emergency Fund) — this one’s crucial.
It’s about creating a safe space — so that when life throws something unexpected at me, I don’t panic, I act.
It doesn’t have to be big at first, but knowing it’s there gives me peace of mind. It’s not just money — it’s freedom. The freedom to say “no” to bad jobs, the freedom to take a break if life hits hard, and the confidence to take smarter risks in the future.

Later in the evening, I swam 960 meters and cooked myself a solid dinner — it was tasty.
Wrapped up early and went to bed with a clear mind and steady thoughts.
