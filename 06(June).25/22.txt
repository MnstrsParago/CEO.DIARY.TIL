I continued my cleaning today â€” it took me about four hours.
Had a good lunch (pilaf ðŸ˜‹), and in the evening, I went swimming â€” managed to cover 960 meters.
After coming home, I spent some time talking with my parents.

Unfortunately, I didnâ€™t have the energy left to study, which I regret a little.
But not every day has to be productive â€” some days just help me recharge for the next one.
