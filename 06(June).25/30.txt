## 30th June 2025

The day didn’t start off so great — I woke up with a discomforting pain in my back, which made it hard to sleep properly.
After breakfast, my friend came over and we began packing up all our things in preparation for moving out of the dorm.

In my case, I delivered all my belongings to my sister’s place — my new temporary base.
Later on, I played some basketball, helped out a few friends, and eventually knocked out for a nap.

On the IT side, I made a decision to begin a new project — this time in machine learning.
It’s going to be long-term, and I’m not planning to rush it. I want to build it with care, understanding, and purpose.
