## 28th June 2025

Today I didn’t really do anything useful for myself — but I decided not to beat myself up over it.

I ended up watching two disaster movies: 2012 and Greenland.
There’s something about watching human behavior in extreme situations that fascinates me. It’s like seeing raw psychology in motion.

If I manage to go to bed early tonight, I’ll be glad — it means I’ll wake up early tomorrow.
Most people around me will probably sleep in anyway. Some are recovering from a party, others are getting ready for a 24-hour qualifying hackathon.
