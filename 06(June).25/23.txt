Preparations for moving out of the dorm have officially begun for me.
Got duplicate keys made, bought a lamella (which turned out slightly too long), trimmed it down manually with a knife, and installed it under the bed.

Also got a fresh haircut and helped my sister at the bank with some errands.
Managed to complete just one task for the Excel project — the day went fairly well overall.

Still, I feel like I’m not putting in enough effort toward my future career. That needs more attention.
