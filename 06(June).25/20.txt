## 20th June 2025

Today I didn’t get much done — but I allowed myself to rest, which is also a necessary part of the process.
There’s still a lot on my to-do list, and I have ten days until the deadline. I really hope to complete everything in time, and if I manage to pull it off, I’ll be genuinely proud of myself.
