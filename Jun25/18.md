# REPORTS

## 18th June 2025

Today wasn’t my most productive day, but I’m grateful to be making some progress — even if it’s just small steps. I spent time working with Microsoft Excel, focusing on data manipulation (Finding and replacing values, Sorting and Filtering data, Freezing regions, Preparing to print), functions (IF, LEFT, RIGHT, DATEDIF, IF with AND/OR, VLOOKUP, IFERROR, CONCATENATE, ISBLANK, COUNT, COUNTA, COUNTBLANK, COUNTIF, AVERAGEIF, COUNTIFS, SUMIFS, splitting text into columns), and keyboard shortcuts. I didn’t quite make it to pivot tables, though — ran out of time. Interestingly, I’ve done it before in Google Sheets without much trouble, but for some reason, Excel feels trickier. Anyway, we’ll see how it goes tomorrow.
