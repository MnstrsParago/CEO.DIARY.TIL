Woke up at 8AM — forced myself to do something.
Took another look at the project, but this time with a realistic lens, not my usual overly optimistic “I’ll finish this in one sitting” mood.

Reflecting on the last bottleneck, a new idea hit me:
Why not create a bot that picks common code patterns based on popular categories?
In other words — let’s put the Pareto Principle to work.
If I focus on coding for the top 20% of categories, I could still cover 80% of the profitable cases.
Yeah, it’s gonna be tedious — but not too tedious. I could probably finish it in a week.

Still… something’s shifting. I’m starting to feel that weird pressure from the outside world.
Everyone's out enjoying their summer, while I’m deep in my grind.
Kinda makes me question my pace — but I know this path is mine.
