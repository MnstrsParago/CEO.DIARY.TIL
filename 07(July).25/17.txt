##17th July 2025

Started the morning on a high note — cleaned up everything around me and cooked myself a solid breakfast.
Even before getting out of bed, I squeezed in some core workouts and light stretching — felt fresh, felt good.

Later, I hopped on my laptop but focused on something new: for the first time, I started manually handling product orders.
Learned how to pack items for Kaspi — definitely a valuable skill for anyone serious about business. Gained solid experience.

After that, I went out to deliver the orders — my sister and her husband treated us to a nice meal.
One of the deliveries was to a fairly influential woman, which added a bit of weight to the day.

By evening, my sister and her family left for a vacation — probably to Burabay.
Suddenly, I had the whole space to myself — and man, I loved it.
That personal space felt like luxury, and I fully embraced the vibe.

Wrapped up the evening with a phone call to my mom.
Even though the day wasn't heavy on IT stuff, it was full of learning, warmth, and comfort.
