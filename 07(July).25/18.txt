##18th July 2025

Started the day with what was basically a perfect breakfast — I had bought all the right ingredients ahead of time, and it really hit the spot.
After that, I went to the mosque, and when I got back, I got straight to work packing up products.

Then... the printer drama started.
Something went completely wrong with the prints, and it turned into a pretty stressful situation, especially for my sister.
I tried not to panic — though I fully understood how important this task was.
Eventually, everything was resolved, and I let out a big exhale. That moment of relief? Priceless.

Later in the evening, I came across some exciting news: ChatGPT had announced a new feature — an agent that can control your desktop through a virtual machine.
It’s not available to everyone yet, but they promised a wider release by early August. Fingers crossed I’ll get to try it soon.

Oh, and randomly — the power at home just cut out for no reason.
But honestly? I didn’t even flinch. I was like “meh, whatever”
