##14th July 2025

Started the day with a solid breakfast — finally, W for the metabolism.
Then sat down and watched some ML videos. Not sure why, but it felt like it might help… somehow.

To be honest, it actually did.
I’ve started to build a clearer mental structure of how AI works.
Not just models and buzzwords — but how the whole system connects.
I’m still miles away from where I want to be, but this stuff genuinely excites me.

I can see myself mastering this in the future — so yeah, today was low-key a good day.
