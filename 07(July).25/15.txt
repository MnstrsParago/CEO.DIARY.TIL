Today stood out in one way — I took another dive into self-reflection.
Sometimes it feels pointless, like I’m just looping around the same thoughts,
but I still believe in figuring myself out — at least to the point where I know my key drivers.

Did a few tasks, handled some stuff with a friend too.
Not a bad day, but not impressive either — just somewhere in the middle.
Also knocked out 10k steps, which I’ll take as a win for the physical stats.
