Today I continued working with AI â€” and honestly, itâ€™s pretty amazing.
Iâ€™m learning new things and Iâ€™m genuinely proud that things are slowly but steadily starting to click.
Most importantly â€” I feel like Iâ€™m becoming the person I want to be.

Later, my sister taught me another part of their business workflow â€” and I actually really liked it.
We rode an electric scooter to deliver a Kaspi order to the pickup point.
On the way back, I got off halfway to pick up a Wildberries order.
This was actually my first time ordering something from an international online store.

And it wasnâ€™t just any product â€” it came with 100% cashback just for leaving a review.
The item itself was cute and Iâ€™m definitely going to gift it to my girlfriend â€”
I think sheâ€™ll appreciate it ðŸ§¡

On my way back, I also picked up some cardboard boxes from a store, because my sister needed them for packaging.

Also â€” that business bot project... Itâ€™s turning out really cool.
Iâ€™m applying so much of what Iâ€™ve learned over the past year â€”
Iâ€™m fast at catching patterns and that really speeds up development.

Of course, it still takes a lot of time and effort,
but I believe Iâ€™ll handle it well. ðŸ˜Š
