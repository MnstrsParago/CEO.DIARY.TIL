## 5th July 2025

The day started with plans to play basketball with my high school friends.
One of them, Nurtoleu, is seriously aiming to go pro. There were 12 of us, and we played 5-on-5 full court, rotating one player in and out.

I hadn’t played basketball in a long time.
Ever since my shoulder dislocation on February 3, 2024, I lost the spark I once had for the game — it was like a career I silently let go of. Since then, almost every third game brought some kind of pain. Maybe I could’ve become a decent player...
But I made peace with the decision not to pursue it — out of respect for myself.

Still, I kept showing up. Not for the game, but for the connections.
And I don’t think that’s a mistake — even if today I ended up with a ligament strain in my ankle.
After I got home, I applied some ice, laid down with my leg elevated above heart level, and just tried to stay calm.

Later in the day, I completed 10 product cards and also worked on a brand image for my sister’s business.
She generated it using AI, but as we all know — AI can be a little messy with visual stuff. So I had to clean it up and make it usable.

This time, I earned 300₸ per card and 1,000₸ for the corrected image.
Yesterday, it was 500₸ per card — she gave me a boost just to motivate me. I love her for that.

Oh, and here's how the payment system works now:
the first 10 cards = 300₸ each,
the next 10 = 400₸ each,
and every card after that = 500₸.
