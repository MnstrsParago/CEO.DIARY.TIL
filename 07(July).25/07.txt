Last night, before falling asleep, a powerful idea about mathematics suddenly came to me.
I was honestly surprised by myself — that I could even come up with something like that.

This method, if applied properly, could be something even ChatGPT would take time to understand.
I’ve never explored myself in the realm of mathematical research before…
But I really hope I can realize this idea one day. It could be something truly amazing.
It took me a while to fall asleep after that — my mind was spinning.

In the morning, I cleaned up the living room and the kitchen again, had breakfast, and spent a little time watching YouTube Shorts.
Then I tried to get back into the workflow — but only managed to complete one product card.

But here’s the insight:
That card made me fully realize what I had always known deep inside —
This entire process could be automated.
And I was proud of myself for knowing that — because after creating 33 cards, I now truly understand how the whole system works from inside out.

So today marks the start of my first real startup project.
Something that could solve a real-world problem for businesses dealing with manual product card creation.

Later, my sister also taught me how pre-orders work — it’s such a cool system, and I’m genuinely grateful to be learning all of this.
I’m definitely planning to work with that next.
