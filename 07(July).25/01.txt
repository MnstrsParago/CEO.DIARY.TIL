## 1st July 2025

The day started off pretty well.
I woke up on the hard floor — something I actually really enjoy. Watched a few short videos on ML and then headed out for lunch.

My sister invited me to eat at Peek-a-boo, and we had a deep talk.
She told me that I should try places like this more often — to spark ambition and keep my goals burning bright.
I appreciated that.

She also said something that stuck with me:
"We weren’t born into a poor or rich family. We lived with enough… but still felt like something was missing inside.”
That perspective really hit different — a reminder that internal hunger is what shapes the next version of you.

Afterwards, I chilled in the park for a bit and took a short walk.
Didn’t do anything super productive for the rest of the day — just went to sleep.
