## 4th July 2025

The day started off differently.
Earlier, my sister had suggested that I try creating product cards for Kaspi — so today, I finally gave it a shot.

At first, it was really hard.
I had no clue how to properly fill in all the product details. They kept asking for different specs, and the whole thing felt like a mess.
But strangely enough — it was kind of fun.

The only part I didn’t like was the routine of it. Not because it was tiring — it wasn’t —
but because deep down, I kept thinking: “I could automate this.”
That thought alone kept bothering me. I didn’t act on it — it was just a thought. But still.

By the end of the day, I completed 11 product cards.
My sister paid me 5,500₸ for the work. Not because she had to — but because she wanted me to feel the value of earning, and to spend that money wisely.

I really respect her for that.
She always tries to teach me something — and she genuinely wants me to succeed.
Thank you, my sister. My real sister. 💙
