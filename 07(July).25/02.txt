Today I went swimming again and hit my usual 960 meters.
Later, I spent some time at Nazarbayev University, grabbed some food, and started watching more videos about ML.

To be honest, I really enjoyed them —
it feels like I’m laying the foundation for my future career, possibly as an ML developer.
