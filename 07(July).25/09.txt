## 9th July 2025

Today, I finally finished writing all my past journal entries.
Not gonna lie — I do struggle a bit with staying consistent in filling them out.
Even though it doesn’t take much time, there’s always some resistance.
Still, I don’t want to give up, because I genuinely want to turn this into a solid habit.

Throughout the day, I continued working with AI and realized how important it is to build a strong database structure.
I wrote down all possible options in my notebook and spent a long time analyzing how it could all be set up.

At the same time, I was fully aware of how complex this really is.
But what I loved about this day is that I didn’t limit myself.
I allowed my brain to think freely, explore ideas, and focus deeply on the challenge.
This mindset really helped me zone in on the problem.

What’s more — I started to understand how many companies must’ve gone through similar thinking when building their first databases.
That made this whole thing feel even more valuable.

There’s a big difference between:

Knowing how something works,

Understanding the core logic behind it,

And actually building it from scratch, running all of that through your own brain and body.

That’s what I did today — and I’m proud of that.
