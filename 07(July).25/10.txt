## 10th July 2025

Started my morning on a high note.
Bought a bunch of dairy and healthy products — spent quite a bit of money too — and set up a nice breakfast table for myself and my little sister.
Didn’t dive into IT stuff in the morning, but after lunch, I headed out with a friend to Nazarbayev University to keep pushing my project forward.

Together with him and another mutual friend, we split the cost for a ChatGPT Plus subscription, since it became super necessary.
Also, I bought a few API tokens for GPT — invested 5,000₸ into it, which should last me a while for AI requests.

But man, the obstacles really hit hard today.
While working on certain database tables, I realized some of the fields are ridiculously complex and packed with data.
By my estimate, filling them all manually would take at least 3 months.
That just seemed super inefficient, so I leaned more into ChatGPT to handle it.

But even then, more issues popped up.
The model struggled to tell where it should fill data and where not to, which made the whole process kinda frustrating and really slowed me down.

In the end, I had to pause the project, realizing I lack some critical knowledge to push it further right now.
But surprisingly, I found a book that fits my topic perfectly — almost like it was waiting for me.

To top it off, I got in 12,000 steps today. Not bad.
