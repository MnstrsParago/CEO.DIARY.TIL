##16th July 2025

Ended yesterday by visiting a relative’s place — turned out to be a good vibe overall.
Later, I stayed up trying to help him out with a project, but unfortunately couldn't finish it.
It would've only taken one full day if I had it, but the timing just didn’t line up — still, being present felt important.

By morning, I made it back to NU and got back to my own grind.
Tried adding a few adjustments to the project — just small steps forward.
But nothing really clicked… It felt like I desperately needed some rest.
Still, I didn’t overthink it too much. I kept moving, stayed in motion.
Wrapped the day with a good dinner and called it a night.
