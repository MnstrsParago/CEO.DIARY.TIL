##13th July 2025

Woke up early. Slept late. Again.
Trying to fix my sleep schedule feels like trying to update a legacy codebase — every time I patch something, I break something else.

Helped my sister with a few things, which was cool.
But still… I feel like I’m stuck in some weird mental loop.
Like I’m doing stuff, but none of it really moves me forward.
Feels like I’m fighting a bug I haven’t even defined yet.

What’s missing? Probably discipline. Maybe clarity.
Definitely stability.

Right now, I feel like I’m running on while(True) with no exit condition.
