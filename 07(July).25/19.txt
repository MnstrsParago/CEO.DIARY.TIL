These days are starting to feel seriously full â€” in a good way.
Iâ€™ve officially been living on my own for the third day now, and honestly, itâ€™s super relaxing.
This kind of independence is something Iâ€™ve been craving for the past year â€” and now Iâ€™m finally getting a taste. Love it ðŸ˜Ž

Got a bunch of chores done around the house, had some solid meals, packed up the products and dropped them off where they needed to go.
I had money on me, so I didnâ€™t stress over anything â€” just vibed through the day.

In the evening, I even went for a little walk, then watched a show before bed.
Sure, I couldâ€™ve studied some ITâ€¦ but you know what? I liked the day just the way it was. :)
