## 6th July 2025

Right after waking up, I cleaned the entire living room and sat down on the couch to get started.
Made a few product cards before my sisterâ€™s husbandâ€™s brother came over. We had lunch together, and while my sister took a nap, I decided to deep-clean the kitchen â€” it was total chaos in there.

Her head was hurting, and I could tell that the clean space really made her feel better.
Later, she invited me out for coffee â€” and I said yes. It was a nice little sit-down.
She mostly talked with my dadâ€™s sister, whoâ€™s almost the same age as her. I just quietly listened and worked on one of the most chaotic product cards Iâ€™ve seen.

That one card took me around 6 hours â€” but honestly, it was worth it. I learned so much just by solving all its small details and structure.

By the end of the day, I had completed 11 product cards â€” 7 of them were special ones, and I added an extra 100â‚¸ to their price as they required extra effort.

Also, I bought tickets to Oral (Uralsk).
I know the upcoming days might be hard for programming, so Iâ€™ll try to wrap up what I can before the trip.

ðŸ’° Earnings recap for the day:

4 standard cards Ã— 300â‚¸

6 special cards Ã— 400â‚¸

1 premium card Ã— 500â‚¸
= Total: 4,100â‚¸
